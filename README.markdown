Placeholder Plugin
====================

This is a quick and simple plugin for jQuery which replicates the placeholder tag functionality promised by HTML5.

Works across all browsers. If the browser supports placeholder already (webkit being the only one so far), the plugin won't interfere.

Check index.html for an example usage of the plugin.

Supports everything that jQuery does, and works with jQuery 1.3.x and 1.4.x.
